# Operation Financial Freedom — Strategy Matrix

This matrix compares the main families of crypto trading strategies from the perspective of a single motivated retail trader.  Use it to decide where to focus effort and which avenues to avoid.

| Strategy Family | Description (1–2 sentences) | Latency Requirement | Data Requirement | Infra Complexity | Retail Feasibility | ML/RL Role | Major Risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Funding‑rate / Basis Trades** | Exploit persistent price differences between spot and futures/perpetual markets by going long the underpriced leg and short the overpriced leg.  Typically delta‑neutral and held over hours or days. | **Low:** seconds to minutes; no sub‑second speed required. | Spot and futures prices; funding rates.  Basic OHLCV data suffices. | **Low:** simple API polling; run on a VPS. | **Yes:** among the most accessible strategies for retail. | **Nice‑to‑have:** ML could help forecast funding spikes or volatility regimes but is not essential. | Basis risk during volatile markets; exchange outages; high funding volatility wiping out gains. |
| **Simple Cross‑Exchange Spreads** | Buy an asset on a cheaper exchange and sell on a more expensive one simultaneously.  Pocket the spread minus fees if you execute both legs quickly. | **Medium–High:** you need to act within seconds; institutional players dominate. | Real‑time quotes from multiple venues; order book snapshots. | **Medium:** must handle concurrent API calls and order coordination. | **Maybe:** feasible only on illiquid pairs or during rare dislocations; opportunities shrink quickly. | **None:** speed and fee optimisation matter more than fancy models. | Execution risk (one leg fills, the other does not); fees/slippage eating profit; missing the window due to latency. |
| **Triangular Arbitrage** | Trade through a cycle of three pairs (e.g. BTC/USDT → ETH/BTC → ETH/USDT) when the implied exchange rate is misaligned. | **High:** requires sub‑second execution; done mostly by bots colocated at exchanges. | Level‑2 order book and tick data to detect mispricing. | **High:** compute for fast pathfinding; concurrency; many API calls. | **No:** unrealistic without low latency and capital across all legs. | **None:** executed deterministically by bots. | Illiquidity in one leg; self‑trade rules; negligible spreads in 2025. |
| **Trend‑Following** | Go long (or short) based on momentum indicators (moving averages, breakouts).  Timeframe typically hours to days. | **Low:** decisions can be made on minute or hourly candles. | OHLCV data; technical indicators. | **Low:** easy to implement with open‑source libraries. | **Yes:** accessible and transparent; drawdown management is key. | **Nice‑to‑have:** ML can help detect regime changes or combine signals but is not required. | Whipsaw during sideways markets; over‑trading due to noise; fees. |
| **Mean Reversion** | Bet that price will revert to a historical average (e.g. Bollinger bands, RSI). | **Low:** similar to trend‑following. | OHLCV data; volatility metrics. | **Low:** similar to trend‑following. | **Yes:** works better in ranging markets. | **Nice‑to‑have:** ML can classify market regimes (range vs trend) to improve entry/exit. | Prolonged trends causing losses; false signals; small edges eroded by fees. |
| **Simple Grid / Quasi‑Market‑Making** | Place buy and sell limit orders around the current price to capture small fluctuations.  Maintain inventory limits to manage risk. | **Medium:** positions must be adjusted every few minutes; not sub‑second. | Order books (level‑1 or level‑2) for chosen pairs. | **Medium:** continuous monitoring and order management. | **Maybe:** can work on minor pairs but inventory risk and competition are high. | **None‑Nice‑to‑have:** ML might adapt grid spacing to volatility, but basic math often suffices. | Inventory accumulation in one direction; adverse selection when volatility spikes; exchange fees. |
| **ML‑Enhanced Signals** | Use supervised algorithms (trees, regressions, neural nets) to predict short‑term direction, volatility, or regime labels. | **Medium:** prediction horizons of minutes to hours; not real‑time tick trading. | Historical trade/order‑book data; engineered features (imbalance, flows). | **Medium–High:** need GPU/CPU for training, data pipeline for features. | **Maybe:** can improve signals, but benefit often small relative to rule‑based baselines. | **Core / Nice‑to‑have:** central to the approach; the entire point is to add ML. | Overfitting to historical data; regime changes; dependence on expensive data sources. |
| **RL‑Based Policies** | Train an agent to select actions (long/short/flat) or adjust position sizes based on rewards (PnL minus risk penalty). | **High:** requires simulated environment with realistic transaction costs. | Large amounts of historical and synthetic data; feature engineering; environment design. | **High:** compute‑intensive training; risk of coding bugs; complex hyperparameters. | **No:** evidence shows retail RL strategies often underperform simpler methods. | **Core:** RL is the method itself. | Reward hacking; overfitting; non‑stationary markets; high compute cost. |

### How to Use This Matrix

Prioritize strategies in rows where **Retail Feasibility** is “Yes” and **Infra Complexity** is “Low” to “Medium.”  Funding‑rate/basis trades and simple trend/mean‑reversion systems are the most promising starting points.  Triangular arbitrage and RL‑based trading are currently out of scope for most individuals without institutional resources.

Add your own notes or adjust feasibility assumptions if your circumstances differ (e.g. if you have access to low latency hosting, or if you can source high‑quality order‑book data).  Leave complex strategies as research projects rather than production trades until you have solid evidence they outperform baselines.
